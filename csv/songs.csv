It's — I'll give you a quick rundown — It's about a bishop and his wife and this violin player in West Virginia. It's about how their daughter lost her mother to mathematics out on a business trip in Detroit [crowd laughs]. Um, it's about a… it has a Top 40 hook part [crowd laughs] that, that, that if, if everybody — if we knew the words we could sing, everybody could sing to it [crowd laughs]. Ah, about pancakes and this guy named Muskrat in — who lives in Richmond, Virginia, who I met when I was playing down there, he plays saxophone. Ah, it's about uh… James Garner and then he — when he was very popular years ago in his part-Brit-Bret Maverick TV shows [crowd laughs]. And it was a well known Hollywood secret that he had an affair with a mad woman with one eye [crowd laughs]. Uh, uh… it's about uh… it's about uh… oh, it's about this little boy who told his father that the Indians are still in the woods, only nobody sees them [crowd laughs]. And uh… it's about sexual pathos of elderly choir boys in uh… Butte, Montana. You know, it's uh — where everybody with the band, and we, we go around all these places and like our big thrill is we copy accents and we go like, ""where were we, where were we last week? Chicago, Chicago."" And that's nutty, it's like Chicago's like a big, one big hit town, you know. And it was nice though. Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman Did a double-quick back flip and slid across the floor The Catholic traffic flowed freely across the river And fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door All right Oh, baby dumpling, mama's in the back tree If the bow breaks, mama might fall Little sad and only, baby don't be lonely Oh, mama knows arithmetic, knows how to take a fall Mama knows arithmetic, knows how to take a fall And the kids are crying, ""Flapjacks, make 'em fat, early in the morning"" Little Jack, grab your hat, hear the breakfast call Muskrat, bat a cat, kick him in the fireplace There's someone in the kitchen blowing ""Dinah"" on their horn There's someone in the kitchen blowing ""Dinah"" like they're born Well, maverick daddy got a one-eyed bride She glides like a monkey-mule kicking on the back slide Over hill, over hill, daddy don't you spill now Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill And Billy he's crying, ""Tomahawk, tomahawk, daddy better duck now"" The Mohawks, the Mohawks, they're still out there in the woods Monatuk, Ocanuk, running through my dreams now With fire on their fingertips and engine screams Fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams [Spoken:] Get funky!

And the thing he did the most, I think, was he always got you thinking about the next guy, took you out of yourself. Out of yourself, it's hard that's something to be able to do. And he, uh, just got you thinking about your neighbor, in some sense. And uh, I guess, it's that idea that, uh, salvation isn't individual, and that, uh, we sort of, maybe we don't rise and fall on our own, you know? Anyway. So I want to do this tonight for Harold Leventhal, and Arlo, and Nora, and especially for Pete Seeger, people who have kept Woody's flame burning and alive for so long. And so many others.",NA

One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside Billy stood in the shadows, his K-bar knife in his hand and the moon slipped behind the clouds Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket, took a breath and let him pass In the early darkness Billy rose up, went into the kitchen for a drink of water Kissed his sleeping wife, headed into the channel and cast his nets into the water of Galveston Bay",The Ghost Of Tom Joad

I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me? At twenty-five a Mustang pony he did steal And he rode her 'round and 'round on heaven's wheel Father Jesus I'm an outlaw, killer and a thief And I slow down only to sow my grief I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me? He cut his trail of tears across the countryside And where he went women wept and men died One night he woke from a vision of his own death Saddled his pony and rode her deep into the West Married a Navajo girl and settled down on the res And as the snow fell he held their beautiful daughter to his chest I'm Outlaw Pete, I'm Outlaw Pete, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Out of the East on an Irish stallion came bounty hunter Dan His heart quickened and burned by the need to get his man He found Pete peacefully fishing by the river, pulled his gun and got the drop He said, ""Pete you think you've changed but you have not."" He cocked his pistol, pulled the trigger and shouted ""let it start"" Pete drew a knife from his boot, threw it, and pierced Dan through the heart Dan smiled as he lay in his own blood dying in the sun And whispered in Pete's ear, ""We cannot undo these things we've done."" You're Outlaw Pete, you're Outlaw Pete, Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? For forty days and nights Pete rode and did not stop Till he sat high upon an icy mountaintop He watched the hawk on a desert updraft, slip and slide Moved to the edge and dug his spurs deep into his pony's side Some say Pete and his pony vanished over the edge And some say they remain frozen high up on that icy ledge The young Navajo girl washes in the river, skin so fair And braids a piece of Pete's buckskin chaps into her hair Outlaw Pete, Outlaw Pete, Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

And the thing he did the most, I think, was he always got you thinking about the next guy, took you out of yourself. Out of yourself, it's hard that's something to be able to do. And he, uh, just got you thinking about your neighbor, in some sense. And uh, I guess, it's that idea that, uh, salvation isn't individual, and that, uh, we sort of, maybe we don't rise and fall on our own, you know? Anyway. So I want to do this tonight for Harold Leventhal, and Arlo, and Nora, and especially for Pete Seeger, people who have kept Woody's flame burning and alive for so long. And so many others.",NA

There's a bar in Tijuana where me and Bobby drink with the same people we'd sent back the day before We met there, she said her name was Louisa, she was from Sonora and had just come north We danced and I held her in my arms, I knew what I would do She said she had some family in Madera county, if she her child and her younger brother could just get through At night they come across the levy in the searchlights dusty glow We'd rush 'em in our Broncos, force 'em back down into the river below She climbed into my truck, she leaned towards me and we kissed As we drove her brother's shirt slipped open and I saw the tape across his chest We were just about on the highway when Bobby's jeep come up in the dust on my right I pulled over and let my engine run and stepped out into his lights I felt myself moving, felt my gun resting 'neath my hand We stood there staring at each other as off through the arroyo she ran Bobby Ramirez he never said nothing, six months later I left the line I drifted to the central valley and took what work yeah I could find At night I searched the local bars and the migrant towns Looking for my Louisa with the black hair falling down",The Ghost Of Tom Joad

Well me and my sister, from Germantown yeah we did ride And we made our beds, sir, from the rock on the mountain side We've been blowing around from town to town looking for a place to land Where the sun could break through the clouds and fall like a circle, like a circle of fire down on this hard land Well now even the rain it don't come around, don't come around here no more And the only sound at night's the wind slamming that back porch door Yeah it stirs you up like it wants to just blow you down, twisting and churning up the sand Leaving all them scarecrows lying face down into the dirt of this hard land Well from a building up on the hill I hear a tape deck blasting ""Home On The Range"" And I can hear them bar rim choppers sweeping low across the plains It's me and you Frank, we're looking for lost cattle, our hooves twisting and churning up the sand Yeah we're riding in the whirlwind, searching for a treasure way down south of the Rio Grande We're riding cross that river in the moonlight way up onto the banks of this hard land Well hey Frank, won't you pack your bags and meet me tonight down at Liberty Hall I just want a kiss from you my brother and we'll ride until we fall We'll sleep out in the fields, we'll sleep by the rivers, and in the morning we'll make a plan Well if you can't make it, stay hard, stay hungry, stay alive if you can and meet me in a dream of this hard land Whoa!
